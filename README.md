## The current situation in the world isn't great, but what can we as developers do to make it better?

Well, one thing that we can do is take an API which just has a lot of data and then we can visualize it, to help spreading the awareness.

We are going to explore the data and be able to see the number of infected people, recovered people and as well the number of deaths.

These statistics will provide us a better understanding of how covid-19 is spreading and affecting people's lives. 

This chart contains a lof of data, but if didn't create a chart, if just had the raw data that would be an array of many numbers that would be unreadable to any human being, but taking the data and making sense of it it's the best thing that we can do in this scenario, so we can visualize the exponencial growth and then we can take action.

Also, in this application we will be able to choose all the countries statistics, so we can see the data of a specific country.
