## This repository contains a COVID-19 Tracker/Stats Application. 

The project is going to fetch the live data from the API using Async/Await syntax. I'm also using React Hooks with the addition of Charts.js, Material UI, and many different modules. 

It can be helpful to have a strong understanding of React's workflow; including data fetching, hooks, folder structure, and more

## Coronavirus is, unfortunately, spreading through the entire planet. The current situation in the world isn't great, but what can we, as developers, do to make it better?

Well, one thing that we can do is take an API which just has a lot of data and then we can visualize it, to help spreading the awareness.

We can help to spread awareness by visualizing the data. The data is fetched from the API and we'll create cards displaying the statistics as well as Charts. This project/application is created using the most modern JavaScript syntax. 

We are going to explore the data and be able to see the number of infected people, recovered people and as well the number of deaths.

These statistics will provide us a better understanding of how covid-19 is spreading and affecting people's lives. 

This chart contains a lof of data, but if we didn't create a chart, if just had the raw data that would be an array of many numbers that would be unreadable to any human being, but taking the data and making sense of it, it's the best thing that we can do in this scenario, so we can visualize the exponencial growth and then we can take action.

Also, in this application we will be able to choose all the countries statistics, so we can see the data of a specific country.
